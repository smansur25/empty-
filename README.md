# # Group Project - *RandomEats*

**RandomEats** How many times have you been to a new restaurant and didn't know what to get? Or even didn't know what restaurant to go to? Well, now we have RandomEats. An app that randomly chooses where you can go based on a few preferences. 

RandomEats is designed with the Yelp API. It can filter restaurants based on the person's location and price range, and food preferences. And then pick a random restaurant for the indecisive. 

As an added feature we may also give them option to randomly select menu items for some restaurants.

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total
